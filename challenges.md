### Challenge 1

## Challenges faced 

(1) Setting up an API for data collection was a bit challenging since it was my first API encounter. I spent most of the time attempting to learn about APIs which turned into a rabbit hole journey, because every documentation suggested a different API to be used, so I was exploring the syntax of the commonly used APIs.

(2) I'm more farmiliar with Python so when boto3 appeared in my research, I quickly looked into it. With the research I made, I can only read in data with boto3 when the AWS account with the 'Bucket' and 'key' are known. In this challenge only the URL is provided so I hit a bedrock with boto3, thereafter I came across the requests and response modules which I found to be easy, hence I resorted to using them.

## Thought process for the challenge 1

(1) Having read the challenge, I downloaded the file and organised the data in Excel to better gain insight of the challenge. Thereafter, I looked into an API I can use to read in the information

## Insight into the data

The challenge was a bit vague at first, so I downloaded the Excel file, sorted the data and put it into a table. It was only then that certain aspects of the challenge surfaced and the challenge made sense.
