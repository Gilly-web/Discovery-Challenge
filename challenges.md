### Challenge 1

## Challenges faced 

(1) Setting up an API for data collection was a bit challenging since it was my first API encounter. I spent most of the time attempting to learn about APIs which turned into a rabbit hole journey, because every documentation suggested a different API to be used, so I was exploring the syntax of the commonly used APIs.

(2) I'm more farmiliar with Python so when boto3 appeared in my research, I quickly looked into it. With the research I made, I can only read in data with boto3 when the AWS account with the 'Bucket' and 'key' are known. In this challenge only the URL is provided so I hit a bedrock with boto3, thereafter I came across the requests and response modules which I found to be easy, hence I resorted to using them.

## Data Wrangling

 Data wrangling was a bit challenging, due to time constraints I couldn't perform it on the provided data. However I would first employ data exploration technique to put the data in a tabular form, this would allow a better visualisation of the data-sets because the current data is almost impossible to visualize it in its current format. Thereafter, I'd scan the data for missing data-sets and if possible fill the missing data-set with the average data of the entire column. Lastly, I would filter out unwanted data as per the requirements of the challenge.

## Thought process for the challenge 1

(1) Having read the challenge, I downloaded the file and organised the data in Excel to better gain insight of the challenge. Thereafter, I looked into an API I can use to read in the information. Once the data was successfully read through the API, the next step was to explore possible ways to find duplicates in the data, outliers and missing data in the provided data file.

## Insight into the data

The challenge was a bit vague at first, so I downloaded the Excel file, sorted the data and put it into a table. It was only then that certain aspects of the challenge surfaced and the challenge made sense.
